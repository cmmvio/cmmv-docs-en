The terms you agree to by using CMMV software and services.

**Last updated March 25, 2025**

## General

### Terms of Service
These Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”) govern your access to and use of the CMMV software and any related services, features, content, or documentation offered by André Ferreira (the “Author,” “I,” “me,” or “my”) from time to time (collectively the “Services”).

### Acceptance
By using or accessing the Services or CMMV, you accept and agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Service and (ii) the MIT License, found below and incorporated herein by reference (collectively referred to as the “Agreement”).

This Agreement constitutes a binding agreement between you (“User,” “you,” and “your”) and the Author. This Agreement represents the entire understanding regarding the Services and shall govern over any prior oral or written agreement or discussions. No other terms or conditions of any external document shall apply to the Services unless explicitly agreed in writing.

The Author may modify, supplement, or amend these Terms of Service. If changes are made, you will be notified via the CMMV website or repository and given an opportunity to review them.

### License
Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, the Author grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, worldwide right to access and use the Services under the terms of the MIT License (the “License”).

The License is granted freely to all users and is valid for use on all supported operating systems. You may use CMMV on multiple devices, provided you comply with the MIT License terms. The full MIT License text is included below.

## CMMV

### A. Free Use
The License permits use of CMMV for free for any purpose, including:
- Personal use (e.g., private projects, research)
- Commercial use (e.g., business applications)
- Non-profit and charitable organizations
- Educational institutions
- Government departments and agencies

There are no restrictions on the scope of use, provided you adhere to the MIT License.

### Not Professional Advice
CMMV assists you in managing data, building tools, etc. However, any materials available through CMMV or its documentation (collectively, the "Service Materials") are for informational purposes only. They are not guaranteed to be correct, complete, or up-to-date, and your use of CMMV and its output is your responsibility. The provision of CMMV does not constitute a guarantee of any specific outcome or make the Author responsible for the success or failure of any project you undertake with it.

## Use of Services
You may use the Services only if you have reached the age of majority where you live and can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. You may not use the Services if you live in a jurisdiction where access to or use of the Services may be illegal or prohibited. It is solely your responsibility to determine whether your use of CMMV is lawful, and you must comply with all applicable laws.

You are prohibited from contributing, posting, or transmitting to the Services any infringing, unlawful, threatening, libelous, defamatory, obscene, indecent, inflammatory, pornographic, or profane content, or any content that could constitute or encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, or otherwise violate any law. Any content you contribute may not contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of “spam.” You may not impersonate any person or entity or mislead as to the origin of your contributions. The Author reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or restrict access to such content.

In my sole discretion, I may terminate or restrict your access to any component of the Services at any time and without notice, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to me, without liability.

## Content and Ownership

### Content
The Services contain content owned by the Author (“Author Content”). I own and retain all rights, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Services and the Author Content, which are protected by copyright and other laws and released under the MIT License.

You must not remove or alter any copyright notices on any copy of CMMV or its documentation.

### Ownership
CMMV and the Services are licensed, not sold. All rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement or the MIT License are reserved by me. You may not copy, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, display, use, or sell any Author Content beyond what is permitted by the MIT License. You must not modify, build upon, or block any portion or functionality of the Services except as allowed under the License.

### Software
I grant you a worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to install and execute CMMV and related software (“Software”) on machines operated by or for you, solely to use the Services in accordance with the MIT License. The Software is licensed, not sold, and includes code released under the MIT License. It may also include third-party code under compatible open-source licenses, as noted in the documentation.

### Restrictions
You shall not (and shall not permit others to):
(i) violate the terms of the MIT License;
(ii) use the Services or Software to provide a competing service;
(iii) remove or modify copyright or proprietary rights notices;
(iv) violate any applicable law or regulation;
(v) disable, hack, or interfere with security mechanisms in the Services or Software;
(vi) include or transmit harmful code (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses);
(vii) alter, disable, or erase data or software without authorization.

## Security and Privacy

### Security
CMMV operates locally on your device. I do not control or store your data unless explicitly stated in future optional services. You understand that use of the Services may involve transmission of data over networks not controlled by me, and I am not responsible for data lost, altered, intercepted, or stored across such networks. I cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never defeat security measures.

### Privacy
No personal information is collected unless you voluntarily provide it (e.g., via community contributions or contact). If optional services are introduced in the future, any data handling will be transparently disclosed.

## Disclaimer of Warranties
All Services are provided “as is” under the MIT License. I make no warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or noninfringement. I do not guarantee that the Services will meet your requirements, be accurate, complete, secure, uninterrupted, or error-free. I will not be liable for unauthorized access beyond my reasonable control or for decisions you make based on the Services.

## Limitations of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, I SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, LOST PROFITS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY. MY TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID ME FOR THE SERVICES (WHICH IS ZERO, AS CMMV IS FREE). THIS LIMITATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

## Term and Termination

### Term
This Agreement begins when you first use the Services and remains in effect until terminated.

### Termination
Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other materially breaches it and does not cure the breach within 10 days of notice, or upon bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings not dismissed within 60 days.

### Effect of Termination
Upon termination, your right to use the Services ends. I may delete any data you provided through optional services (if applicable).

## General Provisions

### Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Brazil. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of Vila Velha - ES, Brazil.
