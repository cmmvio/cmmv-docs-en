# Privacy
The privacy policy you agree to by using CMMV software and services.

**Last updated March 25, 2025**

## Summary
I prioritize your privacy by ensuring you maintain full control over your data. Here's how I handle your privacy based on how you interact with CMMV.

### CMMV Software
- All data is saved locally on your device and is never sent to any servers controlled by me.
- I do not collect any personal data from your use of CMMV.
- I do not collect telemetry data.
- CMMV may connect to the internet to check for updates or download community resources (e.g., plugins), but you can disable this in the settings if available.
- If third-party plugins or extensions are used, their developers are responsible for disclosing any network usage or data collection. I do not control or endorse third-party components.

### Optional Services (if applicable)
- If optional services (e.g., hosting or sync) are introduced in the future, any data stored to provide those services will be clearly disclosed at that time.
- I will ensure transparency about how such data is handled and give you control over it.

### Community Interaction
- If you join the CMMV community (e.g., forums, Discord, or GitHub), any personal information you provide (like an email address) is voluntary and not shared with third parties by me.
- Third-party platforms (e.g., Discord, GitHub) have their own privacy policies, which you should review.

## Privacy Policy

### CMMV Policy on Privacy
I, André Ferreira, am committed to protecting your privacy and security when you use CMMV. This policy explains what personal information (if any) I collect, how it’s used, and the steps I take to ensure it’s handled appropriately.

This policy is designed to align with applicable Brazilian data protection laws, including the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD – Law No. 13.709/2018).

### Who am I?
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “I” refers to André Ferreira, the individual developing and providing CMMV and related resources.

### What is personal information?
Personal information is data that specifically identifies an individual, such as name, email address, or date of birth. Information available in public directories, registries, or publications is not considered personal information under this policy.

### I am accountable to you
I am responsible for any personal information under my control and strive to uphold the privacy principles outlined here.

### Why I collect and use your personal information (if at all)
CMMV itself does not collect personal information. If I need to collect any information (e.g., for community contributions or future optional services), I will:
- Clearly state the purpose before or at the time of collection.
- Use it only for purposes like:
  - Communicating with you (e.g., responding to inquiries).
  - Processing voluntary contributions (e.g., bug reports, code submissions).
  - Complying with legal requirements.
- Obtain your consent where required by law.

You can withdraw consent at any time by contacting me (see “How to contact me” below).

### I limit collection of your personal information
I collect only what’s necessary for specific, disclosed purposes. CMMV operates locally and does not require or store personal data by default. If you interact with me directly (e.g., via email), I’ll only use what you provide voluntarily and for the stated purpose.

### I do not store your content
I do not receive or store personal content you create or save using CMMV on your device. Your data remains yours and stays local unless you explicitly share it with me or others.

### Information from interactions
When you visit a CMMV-related website or repository (e.g., GitHub), I may receive basic technical data like your IP address or browser type via cookies or logs. This is standard for most websites and is used only for troubleshooting or improving the project, not for identifying you. You can disable cookies in your browser settings.

### I limit disclosure and retention of your personal information
I do not disclose personal information to third parties except:
- When required by law (e.g., a court order).
- If you voluntarily share it through public community channels (e.g., GitHub issues).

Any information you provide (e.g., an email for correspondence) is retained only as long as needed for our interaction or as required by law, after which it is deleted.

### I keep your information accurate
If I hold any personal information you’ve provided (e.g., an email address), I’ll ensure it’s accurate and relevant. You can request to review or update it by contacting me.

### Your information is secure with me
I take reasonable steps to protect any personal information you provide, including:
- Physical security (e.g., secure storage of correspondence).
- Electronic security (e.g., encrypted communication where applicable).
- Limiting access to only myself as the project maintainer.
You should also protect your own devices and accounts to prevent unauthorized access.

### Third-party links or tools
CMMV may link to third-party websites (e.g., documentation, community forums) or support third-party plugins. I do not control these external resources and am not responsible for their privacy practices. Check their policies directly if you use them.

### I’m transparent about privacy
I aim to make my privacy practices clear and accessible. This policy is available on the CMMV website or repository, or you can request it from me directly.

### You can access your information
If I’ve collected any personal information from you (e.g., via email), you can request to see it, verify its accuracy, or ask for updates. Contact me as outlined below. I’ll respond with:
- What information I have (if any).
- How it’s used and to whom it may have been disclosed.
- An opportunity for you to review or amend it.

### I respond to your privacy concerns
I’ll address any questions, concerns, or complaints about your privacy promptly. Reach out to me as described below.

### How to contact me
Email me at: `andre@cmmv.io`.

This policy may evolve as CMMV grows. Check the CMMV website or repository for updates. I won’t reduce protections for previously collected information without your consent.
